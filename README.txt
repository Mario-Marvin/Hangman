Game Title:
Hangman Game

Brief Description of the Game:
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to determine a hidden word by
guessing one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to losing
as a part of a hangman figure is drawn. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word or the hangman is fully drawn.

Instructions on How to Play:
1. The game selects a random word, and blank spaces are displayed for each letter.

2. Players guess letters one at a time.

3. If the guessed letter is in the word, it appears in the correct position(s).

4. If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman figure is drawn.

5. The player wins if they correctly guess all letters before the hangman is fully drawn.

6. The player loses if the entire hangman figure is completed before guessing the word.
